# My journey towards Python
In this repository I keep the Python code I write while learning this programming language.
Expectation is to see the "richness" of the code and its quality to improve commit after commit.

To optimise the time spent on this jorney I have decided to write code based on some of the suggestions, exercises and problems found on:

- "Cracking the coding interview, 6th edition" book (you can get it from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.it/cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850) )
- Leetcode.com
- Python crash course from [Google](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)


## Structure of this repository

Material you may find:
- Basic data structures
- Algorithms
- Problems

## What you will not find
This repository is a way for me to keep track of basic concepts of the Python language, meaning that you won't find here advanced usages of the language like AI/Django/whatever else. For those topics, depending on how I am going to like the language, additional repositories will be created.


## Disclaimer
The code available in this repository is the result of training exercises, meaning that it has not passed code reviews/automated tests. Feel free to use it if you want, but please do NOT do so in your production environment.
